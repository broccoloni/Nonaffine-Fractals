# Nonaffine-Fractals

This project was part of my masters work, which was to develop theory for fractals made from IFSs of nonaffine functions. 

To run the code:
run the line in compile.sh to generate the generatedata file. Then run generatedata and input specification to create a fractal database with your specifications (see rungeneratedata.txt for an example).
