#this file is only to show what it's like when you run generatedata for the thesis

$ mkdir Test
$ ./generatedata
How many fractals would you like to generate: 100

What is the directory called (Note: it should already be created): ./Test/

How many points would you like to plot for each fractal: 1000000

How many functions in each IFS: 4

Enter a vector representing the viewing window (eg. minx,maxx,miny,maxy): -3,3,-3,3

0  - Affine
1  - x -> acos(bx) + ccos(dy)+e
2  - x -> acos(bx) + csin(dy)+e
3  - x -> acos(bx) + ctanh(dy)+e
4  - x -> asin(bx) + ccos(dy)+e
5  - x -> asin(bx) + csin(dy)+e
6  - x -> asin(bx) + ctanh(dy)+e
7  - x -> atanh(bx) + ccos(dy)+e
8  - x -> atanh(bx) + csin(dy)+e
9  - x -> atanh(bx) + ctanh(dy)+e
10 - Piecewise Affine

Enter a vector containing the maps you would like to restrict: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10


0 - No restrictions
1 - Ensure there are at least 2 different transformation types
2 - Ensure there is at least 1 of each transformation type

What dispersion of transformations would you like: 0

Generating fractals 0 to 100
